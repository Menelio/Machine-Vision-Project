# Machine-Vision-Project
###h1 Synopsis of project 
This project was written in python and utilizes the keras and Tensorflow module to create a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that will segment MRIs of brain tumors. The project uses a data set from the Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) Challenge 2015, which consists of 5GB of MRIs of brains and brain tumors. The CNN consisted of eight 3D Convolutional layers 4 3D Max pooling layer 4 3D Upsampling layers, and 4 Concatenation layers.
